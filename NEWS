  Add bruteforcing speed and last tried password to progress info.

Version 1.2.1
  2016-06-06
  Fix mutex for dictionary mode.

Version 1.2.0
  2016-01-08
  Root privileges are not required anymore because cryptsetup is called in
  dry-run mode which does not actually change device mapper configuration.

  This should work under non-root user as long as the user can access the
  device. You can e.g. copy LUKS header to a file and run the cracker on
  this file.
  $ dd if=/dev/source of=/tmp/luks-header bs=1M count=10
